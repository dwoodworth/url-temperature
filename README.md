# url-temperature
Demo Project for URL Digital

The application _url-temperature_ should run on any standard LAMP or MAMP stack that satisfies the requirements for the Laravel framework.

The server should be configured to point to `url_temperature/public` as the site root.

The included `url_temperature_schema.sql` file can be used to provision the database and grant the proper user privileges.
